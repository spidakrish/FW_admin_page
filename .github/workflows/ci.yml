# CI Workflow - FW Admin Page
# =============================================================================
# Enterprise-grade CI pipeline with security scanning, code coverage, and
# quality gates.
#
# Jobs:
#   1. lint           - TypeScript type checking and ESLint
#   2. test           - Unit tests with coverage reporting
#   3. security-audit - Dependency vulnerability scanning
#   4. build          - Production build verification
#
# Security Features:
#   - Minimal permissions (principle of least privilege)
#   - Pinned action versions with SHA hashes
#   - Dependency audit with configurable severity threshold
#   - Coverage thresholds to prevent quality regression
